Hi! 
This is a simple application to continuously track the max, min and avg from ages that you can insert.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run in your machine:

### `yarn` or `npm install`
To get all dependencies that I used.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### just for note
This project also uses __Styled Components__ an ES6 and CSS library for style,
__Axios__, promise based HTTP client for the browser, you can access [Axios Docs](https://github.com/axios/axios) for more information and 
__MirageJS__ for mock out backend APIs, you can access [Mirage Docs](https://miragejs.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for more.
